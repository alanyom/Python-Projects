#Your next task will be to fetch data from OMDB. The documentation for the API is at https://www.omdbapi.com/

#Define a function called get_movie_data. It takes in one parameter which is a string that should represent the title of a movie you want to search. The function should return a dictionary with information about that movie.

#Again, use requests_with_caching.get(). For the queries on movies that are already in the cache, you wonâ€™t need an api key. You will need to provide the following keys: t and r. As with the TasteDive cache, be sure to only include those two parameters in order to extract existing data from the cache.

import requests_with_caching
import json

def get_movie_data(data):
    url = "http://www.omdbapi.com/"
    param_diction = {}
    param_diction["t"] = data
    param_diction["r"] = "json"
    resp = requests_with_caching.get(url, params = param_diction)
    print(resp.url)
    return resp.json()
print(get_movie_data("Deadpool 2"))
